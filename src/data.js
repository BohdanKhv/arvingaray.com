    about: `Objectives: Become a member of a superb design-driven team, that allows the use of various design, management and supervision skills with industry, work ethics and audacity. Continue solidifying experience in the challenging discipline of Architecture. Joining painstaking organization wide-awake of sustainability issues is a plus.
    \n
    Over the course of the past years I have diversified my resume with further experience in different areas of the architectural profession. I now have under my belt plenty of experience in Project Management, Supervision, Construction Administration, Bidding and Negotiation as well as specialized exposure to the fields of Building Sciences, Forensic Architecture, Litigation of construction-related cases, as well as expertise in Waterproofing, Roofing and Building Envelope. 
    \n
    I am also certified (30 hours) with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), I am registered as a Class-1 Filing Representative with the New York City Department of Buildings (DOB), have experience with the NYC Landmark Preservation Commission (LPC), as well as scaffold trained to conduct Façade Inspection & Safety Program (FISP) inspections throughout the city. All of the above are very NYC-specific credentials, with projects of all kinds of scope, including high profile residential one-family homes, multi-family residential buildings, as well public buildings involving government agencies like the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA), the City University of New York (CUNY), the Dormitory Authority of the State of New York (DASNY) and the NYC Department of Sanitation (DSNY). 
    \n
    Accumulated experience at mid-size and boutique design firms, working on an array of proposals, commissions and competitions, mostly concentrated on high-rise residential construction. 
    \n
    Early on my career I have the opportunity to entirely design and manage the construction for a 3K sq. ft. single-family home. This represented the opportunity to deal with all the intricacies of a small project, develop an effective design-build strategy, and implement modest but significant sustainable design decisions that added value to the project.

        description: "The design for this single-family home for a young professional couple and their two daughters takes advantage of its particularly sloped location and the existing nature around it. The project looks to recognize the majestic presence of a Guanacaste tree. The sequence established when approaching the site works on this direction too. The problem of having to achieve a visually appealing main façade to the south, while protecting it from the intense tropical sun was resolved by merging the circulation with a multi-program brise-soleil. This helped create a buffer zone with a dynamic element combining sun-shading, evolving vegetation and water collection-irrigation as the main image of the house. The orientation towards a north-south axis takes advantage of the immense shadow-radius produced by the tree canopy, while gaining desirable views of the surrounding and distinctly mountain range and nearby downtown.",
